# AdventOfCode Kotlin StarterKit

The StarterKit I needed these past years to face [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

- One package for each daily puzzle: `dayXX`
- A package with simple code I always use: `kit`
- A package for the code you'll produce and reuse: `common`
- Two parametrized unit tests (_one for each part of the daily puzzle_)
